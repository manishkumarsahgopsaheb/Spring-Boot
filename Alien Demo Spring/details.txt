this project is just the demo of the app using spring framework, in this project we know the details about
@SpringBootApplication--- this annotation is used for starting the spring framework project, just a starer
@Component--- it is the annotation which is actually used to create the object in the spring container
@Autowired -- this annotation is used for conneting the object relation created by spring container
@Qualifier -- this annotation is used for calling the class by the user defined object name of that class,

default name of object in the spring container is the same as class name but all letter in lower case...
eg: for Laptop class , default object name by spring container is laptop
we can change this name by @Component("lap1")--- doi this in the Laltop class, so now the name of object for 
Laptop class in the spring container is lap1,
now we can fetch it by its name----
we can do this for fetching---------@Qualifier("lap1"), while calling the object from the spring container
